# ecommerce-analytics
This is project uses synthetic ecommerce data to showcase tools and techniques to extract, transform, store, and analyze the data.


# Project Outline

## Data Sources and Extraction:

### Variety of Sources:
Simulate a realistic e-commerce environment by incorporating diverse data sources:
- Transactional Data:
- Orders (CSV or JSON)
- Payments (CSV or JSON)
- Shipments (CSV or JSON)
- Customer Information (CSV or JSON)
- Product Catalog (CSV or JSON)
- Inventory (CSV or JSON)


### Behavioral Data:
- Website Clickstream (simulated or using a web analytics platform like Google Analytics)
- Customer Reviews (scraped from the web or simulated)
- Social Media Interactions (if applicable, scraped or simulated)

### External Data:
- Marketing Campaign Data (if applicable, CSV or JSON)
- Economic Indicators (if relevant to your analysis, from public APIs)
- Extraction Challenges:
- Handle inconsistent data formats across different sources.
- Deal with missing or incomplete data.
- Implement incremental data extraction to capture only new or changed data.

## Data Transformation and Modeling:

### Advanced Transformations:

Calculate complex metrics:

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
- Churn Rate
- Product Affinity (using market basket analysis or similar techniques)
- RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Apply data deduplication and merge techniques to create a unified customer view.
- Implement slowly changing dimensions (SCD) to track historical changes in product or  customer attributes.

### Data Modeling Refinement:

- Design a flexible data model that can accommodate future growth and changes in business requirements.

- Consider using a data vault modeling approach for added flexibility and auditability.

## Data Pipeline Enhancements:

### Error Handling and Recovery:
- Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle data issues and pipeline failures.
- Design retry logic for failed tasks.
- Log errors and send notifications to relevant stakeholders.

### Performance Optimization:
- Optimize data transformations and loading processes for efficiency.
- Implement parallel processing where applicable.
- Consider partitioning and indexing in your data warehouse for faster query performance.


## Data Quality Assurance:

### Advanced Data Quality Checks:
- Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns or outliers in the data.
-  Use statistical profiling to monitor data distributions and identify potential data drift.
- Define and enforce data quality rules based on business requirements.

## Analytics and Visualization:

## Advanced Analytics:
- Build predictive models to forecast sales, customer churn, or inventory needs.
- Implement customer segmentation to identify high-value customer groups.
- Conduct A/B testing analysis to evaluate the impact of marketing campaigns or website changes.

## Interactive Dashboards:
- Create dynamic dashboards that allow users to explore data and drill down into specific metrics.
- Use visualization best practices to effectively communicate insights.
- Incorporate interactive elements like filters, slicers, and drill-throughs.
